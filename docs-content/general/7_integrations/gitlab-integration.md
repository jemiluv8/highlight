When you enable the Gitlab integration, Highlight will allow creating Tasks from the session replay and errors viewer. Track bugs or enhancements for your app as you triage frontend and backend errors or watch your users' replays.

To get started, go to the [integrations](https://app.highlight.io/integrations) and click the "Connect" button in the GitLab section.

## Features

1.  [Comments](../6_product-features/3_general-features/comments.md) can create a Gitlab issue filled out with the body of the comment and link back to the Session.

2.  [Grouping Errors](../6_product-features/2_error-monitoring/grouping-errors.md) shows a shortcut to create a Gitlab task pre-populated with the error linking to the full context of how the error occurred.
